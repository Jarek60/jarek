"""
1. 9 datatypes
2. integer, float, complex, string, list, dictionary, tuple, boolean, NoneType
3. b and m are floats, d and l are string, e h adn k are list
4. 1 wasn't an integer because it wasn't alone, it was either multiplied with somenthing, in a list with other things, in a function or a decimal point. str() converts the data into a string. 1 was a float.
5. A range, an immutable seuence of numbers.
