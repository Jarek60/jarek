# 7) What does ~/ mean?
#    ~/ means you are in your home or main directory that holds everything in your computer.

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
#    An absolute path gives the name of every folder starting from ~/ up to the folder you are in showing the path you took to get there. Relative path only shows you the parent and child directories you are in.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
#    Starting from my jarek repo the absolute path is jarekescobar/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2. The relative path is ../python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2.

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
#     The command cd .. lets you move there.

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
#     rm ./ would delete my current directory and file.

# 12) What do the following commands do?

# git commit - saves your changes and files that were added onto your local repository.
# git push - saves your local changes onto githubs online repository.

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
#     git add . stages all changes in your current directory and in its subdirectories while git add is only for the specific file mentioned.

#     git status lets you see which files are modified and git log -1 shows the most recent commit history made.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
#     The difference is that the clone repository doesnt belong to you and it creates a copy of all the contents in it. Pulling from it updates your local repo that was cloned, with the latest remote changes.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
#     My most frustrating error was making changes on github then not pulling the changes onto the terminal and vs code before making changes in vscode on the same file so when i tried to save there were errors because it had to push and pull the changes at the same time and didn't work properly. I stopped the sync and deleted the changes on vscode and then properly pulled the changes from github to have the most up to date version.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
#     How can we graph data points on vscode? I was a little confused on booleans but it cleared up.

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
#     Python is named after "Monty Python's Flying Circus."

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print(9754 % 37) # It gives the remainder of the function 9754/37
